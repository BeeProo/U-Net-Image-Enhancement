# U-Net-Image-Enhancement

I have used cars dataset as it is easily available but you can use your custom dataset.

If you want to test an image of your own then rename it to "test_image.jpg" or change the code. 
REMEMBER: check the format(.jpg) of the image before testing or you can change the code according to your image or change the format of the image.

When you run the python file it will give you a .pth file do not remove it, let it be in the parent directory.
